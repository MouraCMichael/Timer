This is a Connect 4 game with mutliple levels of difficulty.  You will play against the computer where your turns will be timmed.  If you do not play within your time limit, then the computer will skip your turn.  You will be promted for a difficulty setting before you begin.  An entry of 1 will give you the most time, and a difficulty level of 10 will give you the least ammount of time.
